    Emission rate for the label slurry open front fattening pig housing system: 70% of the emission rate for the label slurry fattening pig housing system (14.07.2010). 
    According to the consensus obtained in the workshop at ART Tänikon 02/11/07: 34 % Ntot; converted using Nsol of 70% and the emission rate of 48.6 % based on TAN.
