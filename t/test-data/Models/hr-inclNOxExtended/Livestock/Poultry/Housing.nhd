  Computes the NH3 emission, the N flux into the housing and the N flux out of the house from poultry housing per year.

+description 

  This process calculates the NH3 emission in poultry housing
  depending on the N excretion and the housing systems. The NH3
  emission is assumed to be proportional to the total N excretion of
  the animals because the contaminated surfaces will primarily drive
  emissions, which will remain active even when animals are on the
  pasture or exercise yard.

  A proportional correction is applied according to the area per
  animal.

  A correction is applied if the part of the day grazing is above a
  defined grazing hours per days.

  \subsubsection{Definition of System boundaries for the housing Process:}

  For housing systems with integrated exercise yards, it is difficult to
  distinguish between emissions from housing, exercise yard and storage. 
  For these housingtypes the emission may be only validated for the sum of
  housing, exercise yard and storage emission.
