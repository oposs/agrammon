Describes correction factors for the loose housing slurry system for dairy cows.

+description
 
 This process describes the correction factors for the loose housing slurry system for dairy cows such as the housing specific emission rate, the area per animal correction, the liquid share and solid share.

    Emission rate for the loose housing slurry system for dairy cows.  According to the consensus obtained in the workshop at ART Tänikon 02/11/07: 11% Ntot; converted using Nsol of 60% and the emission rate of 18.3% based on TAN. Reference value UNECE(2007): 11 kg HN3 = 8% TAN.

    For the loose housing slurry system 100% of the manure goes into
    the liquid fraction of the storage/application.

  ++description
    According to the consensus obtained in the workshop at ART Tänikon 02/11/07: it is assumed that additional surfaces are entirely used since barriers are hardly fea-sible. The emission is increased by 5% per 10% of additional surfaces up to a maximum of 50% additional surface.
