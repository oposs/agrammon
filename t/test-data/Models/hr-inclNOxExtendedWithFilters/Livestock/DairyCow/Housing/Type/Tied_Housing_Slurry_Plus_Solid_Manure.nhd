Describes correction factors for the tied housing liquid solid system for dairy cows.

+description
  
  This process describes the correction factors for the tied housing liquid solid system for dairy cows such as the housing specific emission rate, the area per animal correction, the liquid share and solid share.

    Emission rate for the tied housing liquid solid system for dairy cows.  According to the consensus obtained in the workshop at ART TÃ¤nikon 02/11/07: 4% Ntot, converted using Nsol of 60% and the emission rate of 6.7% based on TAN.
