 Computes the annual NH3 emission from grazing cattle.

+description 

 This process calculates the annual NH3 emission from grazing cattle based
 on the total N excreted on the pastures. The N excreted is calculated 
 according to the time the animals spend on the pasture. It assumes that the 
 excretions on the pasture are proportional to the time the animals are grazed.

  ++description
  Emission rate for the calculation of the annual NH3 emission during grazing for cattle. 5% Ntot (conversion with a portion of Nsol of 60%: EF 8.3% TAN; value based on Table 1 (Mean emission rate of 3.1% N excreted; range: 1.6-5.7% for grazing cows on a sward fertilized with 250 kg N/y) of Bussink (1992) and Table 3 (Mean emission rate of 3.3% N excreted; range: 0.0-7.4% for grazing cows on a sward fertilized with 250 kg N/y) of Bussink (1994). The corresponding value is rather lower for Switzerland since the level of fertilization is lower resulting in a lower level for crude protein. The N level in the fodder of the sward fertilized with 250 kg N/y (31 g/kg d.m.; Table 4) is comparable to values common for Switzerland (Bussink (1994). The EF chosen includes a safety margin.
