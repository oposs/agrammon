Describes correction factors for the conventional slurry pig housing system. 

+description
 
 This process describes the correction factors for the conventional slurry pig housing system such as the housing specific emission rate, the liquid share and solid share.

    Emission rate for the conventional slurry pig housing system. 
    According to the consensus obtained in the workshop at ART TÃ¤nikon 02/11/07: 17 % Ntot; converted using Nsol of 70% and the emission rate of  24.3 % based on TAN.
