+short

  Computes the correction factor of the housing
  emission if the number of grazing hours per day does increase 
  a specific limit.

+description

  This process calculates the correction factor for the non
  proportional change of the housing emission according to the
  grazing hours per day. Source is Phillips et al. (1998) and  Gilhespy et al. (2006)
  empirical estimation was done by Thomas Kupper.
