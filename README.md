# Agrammon
## The simulation model
A￼mmonia volatilisation is a significant source of nitrogen (N) loss in agriculture. Almost one-third of the N load of farmyard manure is lost this way, resulting in both a financial loss as well as diminished productivity for the farmer. At the same time, ammonia emissions are detrimental to the environment, in particular to natural ecosystems.

￼The simulation model Agrammon allows ammonia emissions to be calculated, and shows how changes in structure and production methods at the farm level affect emissions.

￼The model was developed by the [Swiss College of Agriculture (SHL)[(http://www.shl.bfh.ch/) and the companies [Bonjour Engineering GmbH](http://http://www.ecodata.ch) and Oetiker+Partner AG(https://www.oetiker.ch), with support from the [Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN)](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home.html).

## Port to Perl6
The existing Agrammon web application is being ported to Perl6.
