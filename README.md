# Agrammon

## The simulation model
Ammonia volatilisation is a significant source of nitrogen (N) loss in
agriculture.  Almost one-third of the N load of farmyard manure is lost this
way, resulting in both a financial loss as well as diminished productivity
for the farmer.  At the same time, ammonia emissions are detrimental to the
environment, in particular to natural ecosystems.

The simulation model Agrammon allows ammonia emissions to be calculated, and
shows how changes in structure and production methods at the farm level
affect emissions.

The model was developed by the [Swiss College of Agriculture
(SHL)](http://www.shl.bfh.ch/) and the companies [Bonjour Engineering
GmbH](http://http://www.ecodata.ch) and [Oetiker+Partner
AG](https://www.oetiker.ch), with support from the [Federal Office for the
Environment (FOEN)](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home.html).

## Port to Perl6

The existing Agrammon web application is being ported to Perl6.
