# Agrammon

## The simulation model

Ammonia volatilisation is a significant source of nitrogen (N) loss in
agriculture.  Almost one-third of the N load of farmyard manure is lost this
way, resulting in both a financial loss as well as diminished productivity
for the farmer.  At the same time, ammonia emissions are detrimental to the
environment, in particular to natural ecosystems.

The simulation model Agrammon allows ammonia emissions to be calculated, and
shows how changes in structure and production methods at the farm level
affect emissions.

The model was developed by the [Swiss College of Agriculture
(SHL)](http://www.shl.bfh.ch/) and the companies [Bonjour Engineering
GmbH](http://http://www.ecodata.ch) and [Oetiker+Partner
AG](https://www.oetiker.ch), with support from the [Federal Office for the
Environment (FOEN)](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home.html).

Please see the [Agrammon website](https://www.agrammon.ch) for more details.

## Port to Raku

This is a port of the existing Agrammon web application to Raku.  It will
be finished by Christmas.

## Running tests

To only run unit tests, set `AGRAMMON_UNIT_TEST=1` in the environment.  The
integration tests currently have quite some setup dependencies; this should
be addressed in the future.

## Database setup (PostgreSQL)

Install or use existing PostgreSQL database server:

CREATE GROUP agrammon_user;
CREATE USER agrammon;
ALTER GROUP agrammon_user ADD USER agrammon;
CREATE DATABASE agrammon OWNER agrammon;

Load a database dump (auto creation not yet implemented)

## Setup Web App

Install npm, jq, and libperl-dev from your distro and then run

mkdir -p public # first time only
./bootstrap
./configure
./make

Point your config file to the Agrammon database.
Adapt runWeb.sh to point to your config file and model.

./runWeb.sh

and point your browser to the shown URL (defaults to localhost:20000)

## REST Api

The Agrammon model can be accessed via a REST interface, for details see the
[online documentation](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://model.agrammon.ch/single/api/v1/openapi.yaml)

## Server Installation

./bootstrap
./make dist
scp agrammon-$VERSION.tar.gz server:sources/
ssh server
cd sources
tar zxf agrammon-$VERSION.tar.gz
cd agrammon-$VERSION
./configure --prefix=DESTDIR
make
make install

(Re-) start agrammon service with appropriate config file
